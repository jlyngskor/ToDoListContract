# To-Do List Contract

## Project Description

The To-Do List Contract is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that allows users to manage their personal tasks in a transparent, immutable, and secure manner. This smart contract enables users to create, complete, and delete tasks while ensuring data integrity through blockchain's inherent properties.

Built using Solidity and deployed on the Core Testnet 2, this project demonstrates the practical application of smart contracts for everyday productivity tools. Each user maintains their own private task list that is stored on-chain, providing persistence and accessibility from anywhere.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize personal productivity management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a truly decentralized task management system. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized servers and third-party dependencies, giving users complete ownership and control over their personal data.

By building on blockchain infrastructure, we envision a future where productivity tools are:
- **Censorship-resistant**: No central authority can modify or delete your tasks
- **Always accessible**: Available 24/7 without server downtime
- **Transparent**: All operations are verifiable on the blockchain
- **User-owned**: Complete data ownership without vendor lock-in

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with descriptive content and automatic timestamp
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed with immutable completion records
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove unwanted tasks from your list permanently

### Advanced Features
- **User Isolation**: Each user maintains their own private task list
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient contract design to minimize transaction costs
- **Event Logging**: All task operations emit events for easy tracking and frontend integration
- **Data Validation**: Built-in checks to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid operations

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Users can only modify their own tasks
- **Input Validation**: Prevents empty tasks and invalid operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive require statements with descriptive error messages

### Technical Features
- **Solidity 0.8.19**: Built with the latest stable Solidity version
- **Hardhat Integration**: Complete development environment setup
- **Core Testnet 2**: Deployed on Core blockchain's test network
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging for all operations

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks by categories or tags
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to tasks
- **Due Dates**: Add deadline functionality with automatic reminders
- **Task Descriptions**: Extend tasks with detailed descriptions and notes

### Medium-term Features
- **Collaboration**: Share tasks with other users and collaborative task management
- **Task Templates**: Create reusable task templates for recurring activities
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion statistics
- **Mobile DApp**: React Native mobile application for iOS and Android

### Long-term Vision
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Deploy on multiple blockchain networks
- **Decentralized Storage**: Integrate with IPFS for storing large task attachments
- **Token Rewards**: Gamification with token rewards for task completion
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven feature development and governance
- **Enterprise Features**: Team management, project tracking, and advanced analytics
- **AI Integration**: Smart task suggestions and productivity insights

### Technical Roadmap
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Deploy on scaling solutions for reduced gas costs
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Implement proxy patterns for contract upgrades
- **Oracle Integration**: Connect with external APIs for enhanced functionality
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Add privacy features for sensitive tasks

## Usage

### Contract Functions

- `addTask(string memory _content)`: Add a new task
- `completeTask(uint256 _taskIndex)`: Mark a task as completed
- `deleteTask(uint256 _taskIndex)`: Delete a task
- `getTasks()`: Retrieve all user tasks
- `getTaskCount()`: Get total number of tasks
- `getTask(uint256 _taskIndex)`: Get specific task details

### Events

- `TaskCreated(address indexed user, uint256 taskId, string content)`
- `TaskCompleted(address indexed user, uint256 taskId)`
- `TaskDeleted(address indexed user, uint256 taskId)`
